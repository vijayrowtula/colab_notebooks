Below are few colab notebooks, created for self practice. Examples are picked from multiple sources (mentioned in first cell of each notebook). I used pytorch and keras. I also tried converting few keras examples from "https://keras.io/examples/" to pytorch.

# Supervised classification / regression
* Simple CNN - MNIST 
* LSTM IMDB (pending)
* Simple CNN Fashion MNIST (pending)
* Simple CNN CIFAR 10, 100 (pending)
* VGG16 - CIFAR 10, 100 (pending)
* ResNet - CIFAR 10, 100 (pending)
* Inception - CIFAR 10, 100 (pending)
* DenseNet - CIFAR 10, 100 (pending)
* EfficientNet - CIFAR 10, 100 (pending)

# Semi supervied learning
* Pytorch implementation of "Semi-supervision and domain adaptation with AdaMatch" (pending)
